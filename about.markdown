I'm Cian Synnott, and this is where I put my technology-related writing.

I'm interested in large-scale distributed systems, approaches to production operations &amp; security, and how technical teams work.

I've worked as a programmer, sysadmin and SRE across <a href="https://datadoghq.com/">Datadog</a>, <a href="https://circleci.com/">CircleCI</a>, <a href="https://www.hostedgraphite.com">Hosted Graphite</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com">Amazon</a> and a couple of Irish ISPs.

I live with my family in the hills above Nenagh, Co. Tipperary.
