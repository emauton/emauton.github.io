From time to time I'm asked how I approach getting started in a new area - a new job or a new role. I'm told I do this well. Notes I find myself sharing:

*   A [short piece on onboarding](https://gist.github.com/emauton/e470a1f84da1c615c393d7b37a37624d) I wrote about my first 6 months at Datadog.
    *   This was quickly typed out as a response to a question on [RLS](https://randsinrepose.com/welcome-to-rands-leadership-slack/); it's a bit stream-of-consciousness but interesting.
    *   The summary [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLu3NazBbLw) and [notes](https://www.ricklindquist.com/notes/the-first-90-days) on Watkins' [The First 90 Days](https://hbr.org/books/watkins) linked here are particularly useful I think.
*   When moving to my current role in late 2022 - which is larger than the one I started in - I took similar approaches, in particular the ongoing list of "hypotheses/questions" to guide early conversations.
    *   I also collected notes on "hopes" - a common question I have when meeting folks in a new area is what they're hoping for (or worried about) as a new senior person steps into the space.
    *   I find at some point I've built up enough context and stop updating these lists; usually after 2 months or so in the new space.
    *   Compare [The Blue Tape List](https://randsinrepose.com/archives/the-blue-tape-list/).
*   An alignment exercise I use is to outline my [job description](https://emauton.org/2022/11/13/writing-your-job-description/) from time to time and share it, in various formats.
    *   This might not land well in every environment, but has worked well for me.
    *   Note that there's a section on this in the [Staff Engineer's Path](https://noidea.dog/staff) which is worth owning if you don't have it already.
*   [Starting a new job as a Staff+](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uA00zR0Fmck) from [Amy Unger](https://amyunger.com/) is very well framed and full of good ideas.
