title: Waldschattenspiel

I got a copy of the lovely
[Waldschattenspiel](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/1070/waldschattenspiel)
or "Shadows in the Woods". It's a cooperative game for children (and one adult)
where a group of Dwarves need to unite under one tree while a light - a will o'
the wisp? - moves through the forest and freezes anyone it touches with its
light.

It comes with a set of wooden pawns for the Dwarves, and little triangles of
felt to make into hats. I had great fun gluing the hats on last night, and Mags
made some lovely little beards for them from some toweling.

Really looking forward to playing this with the children over the Christmas
holidays.

Pictures below.
