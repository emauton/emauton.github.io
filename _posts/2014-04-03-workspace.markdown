I'll be working and studying from home for the next while, so we put together
a nice corner office space I can use.

It's in our bedroom, but we've partitioned it from the room proper with a
curtain that can draw across, which works well. Otherwise it's a big
improvement on kitchen table / small computer desk / other arrangements
we've tried.

Picture below.
