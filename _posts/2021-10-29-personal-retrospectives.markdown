title: Personal retrospectives
---

As an expansion of my [snippets](https://emauton.org/2015/11/05/snippets/)
habit, for the last 7 years I've written up a "yearly snippets" doc each year -
a personal retrospective for the year.

I've used various formats - from "incident review" style through
"[4Ls](https://www.retrium.com/retrospective-techniques/4ls)" - but always with
the intention of sharing more broadly than just to me and my manager. My
colleagues have generally appreciated the perspective, and some have taken
up the practice.

One of my favourite things about doing this is that it's **for me**. Yes, it's
useful to my manager (and a useful way of "managing up"). I use it as input
to the local performance and review system. But I'm the main audience and it's
my practice. I *hate* the kinds of performance mangement systems we see in tech
companies. Having something that "works around" them to my benefit is very
freeing.

Anyhow, [Stig](https://www.brautaset.org/) and I wrote up some notes and
guidance about the idea at `$current`:
