title: The ITwhatnow?
---
I don't know a great deal about internetworking or Internet governance, but I take an interest.

Lately I've been curious as to why folks are talking about the [International Telecommunication Union](http://www.itu.int/), the [International Telecommunication Regulations](http://www.itu.int/osg/spu/stratpol/ITRs/mel-88-e.pdf) and Internet governance. I read a few things [here](https://www.google.com/takeaction/) and [there](https://www.whatistheitu.org/) that intimated various kinds of doom and gloom, but had a hard time understanding the details of what's happening and why.

So I was delighted when I stumbled across [a set of articles](http://www.ripe.net/internet-coordination/internet-governance/multi-stakeholder-engagement/itu) by [Geoff Huston](http://www.potaroo.net) - see the section on "WCIT-12".

I've enjoyed everything I've read or watched by Huston, and these are no exception; lots to digest here but I found it was worth it. If you're similarly curious but only have time for one article, read ["It's just not Cricket: Number Misuse, WCIT and ITRs"](http://www.potaroo.net/ispcol/2012-04/itrs.html).
