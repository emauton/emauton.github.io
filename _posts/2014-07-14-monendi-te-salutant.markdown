title: monendi te salutant
---
Talking with [Niall](http://www.heanet.ie/conferences/2011/speakers/id/31) on IRC today, I had a brainwave: with just one letter changed, the [famous Latin quote](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ave_Imperator,_morituri_te_salutant) *morituri te salutant* - "those who are about to die salute you" - could become *monituri te salutant* - "those who are about to be paged salute you".

A noble and fitting handover note for oncall engineers?

Sadly, as is often the case when I take enthusiastic flights into classical translation, I'm off here: [*moriturus*](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/moriturus) is a somewhat irregular thing from the verb [*morior*](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/morior). [*moniturus*](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/moniturus) is active, not passive: it means "about to warn/advise/notify".

To get this right, we need a [future passive participle](http://people.bu.edu/tylert/Latin/participles.html#futurepassive), which it turns out is supplied by the [gerundive](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/gerundive). So that gives us [*monendus*](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/monendus).

> *monendi te salutant*

Not as sweet a solution as the one-letter change complete with "monitoring" embedded, but not bad. Vale!
