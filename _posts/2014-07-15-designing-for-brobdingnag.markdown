title: Designing for Brobdingnag
---
On the topic of [talks](http://emauton.org/2014/07/12/alerting-in-production-systems/), while at [Google](http://www.google.com) I was involved in an interesting [SRE Classroom](https://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa13/training/sre-classroom-non-abstract-large-system-design-sysadmins) event in late 2013. These events were run by many of the [SRE](http://site-reliability-engineering.info/) offices as a way of sharing design approaches with software and systems engineers who might lack exposure to large-scale systems.

I later gave my talk from the Dublin event to [devops.ie](http://www.meetup.com/DevOps-Ireland/events/159158512/) in February 2014. PDF with speaker notes from that event:

[Designing for Brobdingnag: considerations in scaling large web systems](/talks/brobdingnag-notes.pdf).
 
> Today, we're focusing on technical designs in large-scale software environments, and 
> patterns which we've found work well.
> 
> These can be relatively difficult to get exposure to.
> 
> This won't be an exhaustive treatment, but we hope to give you:
> 
> * an appreciation of the kinds of constraints and opportunities we have at scale;
> * some tools for approaching design;
> * and a better idea of the kinds of systems SREs engage with.

Note the "Resources" slide towards the end: lots of good links on design and distributed systems there.

*Based on presentations at the London and Mountain View SRE Classroom events by Matt Brown, John Neil and Robert Spier. I also include ideas from Jeff Dean's talk [Building Software Systems At Google and Lessons Learned](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=modXC5IWTJI). Many thanks to Niall Richard Murphy, Alex Perry, Laura Nolan and Pete Nuttall for assistance, ideas and review.*
