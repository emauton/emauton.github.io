title: The Dark Room

Growing up, I loved adventure games, so I love [the Dark Room](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvkjP6dqpfY).

When I was *very* much younger, I used to map these games out. Here's a rather rough attempt for this game. Remember that using any kind of help or walkthrough without painstakingly mapping it out yourself is immoral.

* [room.json](/code/room.json) - a [JSON](http://www.json.org) representation of the map, with Youtube video keys;
* [room.py](/code/room.py) - a simple script to spit out a [dot](http://www.graphviz.org) format graph;
* [room.svg](/img/room.svg) - the resulting delightful mess of a map.

Probably the most useful piece is the JSON file from which one could likely make something more readable. It was fun thoroughly exploring the game in any case. :o)
