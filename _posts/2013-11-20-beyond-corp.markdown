For the last couple of years at [work](http://www.google.com/) I've been
part of "Beyond Corp", a programme to
> Re-architect corporate services to remove any privileges associated with

Doing this at a large, 15-year-old company with an extensive legacy IT
infrastructure is hard. It's been interesting.

Earlier this month, my colleagues Jan Monsch and Harald Wagener presented
a [talk about the programme](https://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa13/enterprise-architecture-beyond-perimeter)
at [LISA '13](https://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa13). It's a detailed
overview of our background, vision and architecture, along with a discussion
of challenges we've met along the way. I had planned to present, but family
life intervened and Harald heroically stepped in. :o)

It's a great talk; strongly recommended to anyone with an interest in modern
security and management of large, mobile client networks.
