title: Tree planting 2020
---

Today we had our second planting for <a
href="https://www.treesontheland.com/">Trees on the Land</a>. We started with
one thousand trees - a mix of hawthorn, hazel, birch, oak, and rowan.

Given that the weather this weekend <a
href="https://www.rte.ie/news/weather/2020/0216/1115593-weather/">has a
name</a>, we weren't sure how it would go. The day started bright and clear
though, so we set up some shelter as intrepid friends arrived for the <a
href="http://www.maryrobinsoncentre.ie/meitheal.html"><i>meitheal</i></a>.

Storm Dennis was kind enough to grant us a few hours of clear weather, in
between beating us indoors for lunch and tea with rain and snow (!)

We got a little over half the trees planted. The rest will have to wait for
better weather.
