I love how expressive the kids' art can be. This afternoon, K and I had a disagreement about computer-gaming time. She stomped off, furious, and took some time alone as she often does (runs in the family, apparently ...).

Later, I went to my [desk](http://emauton.org/2014/04/03/workspace/) upstairs. After a few minutes, I glanced over to my refill pad and saw this:

A thing of furious beauty! Flipping back a page, I found some practice studies. I particularly like the one on the left:

A good discussion ensued. :o)
