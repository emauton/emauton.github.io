title: Double nucleus beehive box
---

Latest little beekeeping equipment project is a "double nucleus" hive box.

The objective is to have a simple way to make up small new colonies (in
particular to get queens mated). Sharing the one box means the colonies
share heat across the partition. Apparently they also are a bit easier to
unite if one of the queens fails to mate for some reason, as they're
familiar with one anothers' smell.

All I did was split one of my [8-frame Rose hive
boxes](http://emauton.org/2019/03/10/8-frame-rose-beehive-boxes/) with a 9mm board - a
little finicky to make a tight fit and fill in gaps, but fun work.  There's a
little play in the boxes (because I wanted an even 320mm external dimension) so
4 frames still fit - snugly - either side of the partition.

I drilled out the entrance holes, and I put a 6mm "lift" on top of the
box with strip wood - my boxes are
[bottom-spaced](http://www.dave-cushman.net/bee/torb.html) so the usual inner covers that I build have a 6mm lift on the bottom (to provide space over the frame top bars). I wanted the lift fixed in this case, so I can just use a flat board for a cover. Probably I'll split that and give it a duct tape hinge.

The patterning at each end is just to help the bees distinguish. Orientation of the box should be enough, but a little extra help is no harm. [Karl von Frisch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_von_Frisch#Bee_perception) showed that bees can distinguish blue/yellow patterns like this.

I'll probably try the box out later in the season - I'd like to try hatching, mating and *maybe* even overwintering a couple of queens in it.
