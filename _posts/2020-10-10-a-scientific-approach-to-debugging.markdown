Recently, a friend got in touch to ask for some help:

> When it comes to debugging an issue, I'm able to set a breakpoint and debug
> into the test to see the error - like a stack trace or whatever - but when it
> comes to fashioning a fix, the actual issue is often something else. Like the
> stack trace is a symptom, not a cause.  How do I train my brain to figure out

I was curious what my team at `$currentplace` thought, so I forwarded the
question to them over Slack. Colleagues from across our engineering teams
dropped by to help, and we came up with some notes to pass back to my friend.

However, someone ratted me out to the corporate blog crew. :o) So this post was
born:

[A scientific approach to debugging](https://circleci.com/blog/a-scientific-approach-to-debugging/)

It includes my favourite debugging story, about [Maurice
Wilkes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurice_Wilkes), which I first came
across via [Russ Cox](https://research.swtch.com/discover-debug).
