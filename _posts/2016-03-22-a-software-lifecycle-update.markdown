title: A software lifecycle update
---
To my knowledge, <a href="https://plus.google.com/107697769598608888750">Chris Jones</a>, a colleague at Google and one of the editors of the <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920041528.do">SRE book</a>, made this diagram for a university talk he gave on production engineering.

It upends the classic software lifecycle image in a useful way, I think: probably the first four boxes should be even smaller. ;o)

I can't for the life of me find the talk, but I'm always telling people about the image, so I'm just putting it here somewhere I can link to while making sure it's credited to Chris. :o)
