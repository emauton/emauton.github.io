title: A safe pair of hands
---

A lot of ink has been spilled about progressing from one "level" of
engineering to the next: junior to intermediate; intermediate to senior; and
recently we see more about senior to [staff](https://noidea.dog/staff).

There's an important common factor in all of these career steps: being seen as
**a safe pair of hands**. This becomes central as you become more senior.

Yonatan Zunger presented a great talk at LeadDev last year that I find
myself referencing a lot: [Role and Influence: the IC trajectory beyond
Staff](https://leaddev.com/sites/default/files/2021-09/Role%20and%20Influence%20The%20IC%20Trajectory%20Beyond%20Staff.pdf).

Zunger's framing made sense of my roles over the last decade in a way that
[staff archetypes](https://staffeng.com/guides/staff-archetypes) didn't. Rather
than wondering about what archetype I fit in any particular quarter, it's much
easier to think about the mix of technical, people, product, and project
disciplines I'm applying.

The hidden fifth discipline is "adult supervision", and I think that's really
what I'm talking about here.

A thing I love to see - and experience! - in my colleagues is where they take
something on and I know it'll be done *right*. Not exactly like I would do it;
not some kind of ideal that stands independent of our working context; but
*right*.

The problem is solved; the crisis is handled; the relevant people are informed
and involved; risks are surfaced early and when shit goes wrong - as it will! -
no-one is caught out.

This is level-independent! It's perfectly possible for someone to do this in a
_level-appropriate_ way. The problems and relationships you're handling may get
a lot hairier as you step up in seniority, but the basic ideas don't change
much.

<a id="accountable_ref"></a>How _trustworthy_ are you with your work? Do you
often _surprise people_? Can I expect you to be
_accountable_<sup>[1](#accountable)</sup> or do I need to rely on someone else
for that?

If you can answer well - no matter where you are in your career - then you're
building a solid foundation for your next step. **You're a safe pair of
hands**.

[1](#accountable_ref). I've heard the word "accountable" thrown around a lot in industry, often
without definition. Here's mine:

Being accountable for an effort as an engineering leader has two components:
ownership, and communication.

1.   Ownership: the effort is "yours", and you act that way. There may be
     sub-components spread across people and teams, but overall you're the one
     who's on the hook. Your performance is assessed against the results of the
     efforts you lead. Judiciously - not every effort will succeed, and that's
     OK.
2.   Communication: you can tell the detailed story of why we're doing it, how
     it relates to other efforts, how it is progressing. You actively raise
     blocking issues or risks and get the necessary people together to address
     them. Where you can't, you escalate effectively.
