title: Desktop priority chart
---
 I tend to have an unsightly collection of post-its stuck to my monitor, my desk, etc., each corresponding to some task I need to do at work. So, I thought it would be nice to have a little desktop priority chart.

 At first I thought of a strip of card with red, orange, green (for high to low priority). Then I thought some appropriate illustrations would be good, and of course the chestburster from Alien occurred as an obvious top-priority analogue.

 My wonderful housemates M and J provided the other images (a sinister koala for something that is not *yet* a problem; a velociraptor for something that certainly is; a fluffy kitten for the bottom of the chart).

 My other wonderful housemate S provided mounting board and sticky-backed plastic, and with some fun craftwork the priority chart was born. I love it.
