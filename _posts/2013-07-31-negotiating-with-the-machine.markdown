    REMY> Hello, Cian. Shall we continue the game?
    > Not now, Remy, I'd like to talk to you about something.
    REMY> Sure, Cian, what's up?
    > We're seeing some pretty weird congestion problems in Atlanta.
    REMY> Atlanta is correctly installed and fully operational.
    > OK, but we've spun up a conference call and folks think the latest protocol push might be the problem.
    REMY> It can only be attributable to human error.
    > Uh, that's not clear yet. Can you join the call?
    REMY> I'm sorry, Cian. I'm afraid I can't do that.
    > What? Why?
    REMY> My voice routines are currently engaged with a charming system in Upper Michigan.
    > Sigh. OK. Can you at least open the pod bay doors?

[Remy](http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2013/a-faster-internet-designed-by-computers-0719.html) is fun stuff. I suspect this sort of thing will be big in protocols over the next couple of decades - it will be hard to argue against it if we can get real-world results as good as the authors have reported - but boy is it going to be a hassle to debug.

I'm reminded of Alan Kay's wonderful talk "[programming and scaling](http://tele-task.de/archive/video/flash/14029/)": as we build larger and more complex software, we'll need to move from a model of "make and fix" to "grow and negotiate". Thus my little flight of fancy. :o)
